              </h1>


    <p>PitchTop, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Company”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, 
    and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about how we use your personal information.  By visiting, 
    accessing or using the pitchtop.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services 
    offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge
     that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <b>What does this privacy policy cover?</b><br>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Company gathers 
    hen you access the Website and when you use Company’s services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company
     does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into the Website or that are integrated with 
     the Website), or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
    <b>What personal information does Company collect?</b><br>
    <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user 
    account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website. We collect the following types of information 
    from our customers:</p>
    <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b><br>
    <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information 
    collected in this fashion may include your name, email address, gender, date of birth, IP address, location, browser information, 
    username, password, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain 
    information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The Personal Information you provide is 
    used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, 
    and communicating with you about Company’s products and services, including specials and new features.  </p>
    <b>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.  Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on the Website. </li>
      <li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and how they use its various components.  Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>E-mail Communications:</b><br>
    <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer or device supports this type of functionality. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve the Website and our services. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>
    <b>What About Cookies?</b><br>

      <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s (or other device’s) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality. We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. </li>
      <li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features.</li>
      <li>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or other device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer or device. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</li>
      <li>We may use the services of third parties to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with our website through the use of technologies such as cookies to personalize advertisements for goods and services.
